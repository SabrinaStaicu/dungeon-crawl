## Getting started!
1. Install Open JDK
Make sure that the latest LTS (Long Term Support) at least Open Java Development Kit (JDK) is installed on your system.
Executing the java --version command in the shell shows at least the latest LTS version number.

2. Install an IDE that supports Maven and Java
This project was developed in IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate

3. Clone the repo to your local machine
You can do that by running the following command in your terminal, make sure you are in the right directory.
```git clone https://github.com/github_username/repo_name.git```

4. Open the project in your IDE (Maven projects are opened by opening the pom.xml file as a project) and run the project from the App file.
